# Tasks:
# - Try an on-off cycle of 2:1, 0.2:0.1, 0.002:0.001 etc
# what is the shortest on-off cycle you can still see (seizure risk)
# if you want the LED to be at solid 20% brightness, what would the code look like? 
# Code SOS in Morse

# loops? Blink out an SOS pattern with a foreach loop that specifies duration
